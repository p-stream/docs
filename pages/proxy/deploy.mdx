# Deploying the proxy


<Warning>
**Selfhosting the client as well?**

Please read [THIS](./introduction.mdx) and use Method 4 (Docker) or Method 5 (Manual)!

Cloudflare and Netlify's IPs are blocked by FlixHQ and the proxy MUST be hosted on a VPS or other server.

</Warning>


## Method 1 - Netlify (Easy) 

Netlify has a very generous free plan, so you'll be able to host your proxy for free unless you get hundreds of users.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/p-stream/simple-proxy)

<Steps>
   <Steps.Step>
     Create a GitHub account at https://github.com/signup if you don't have one already.
   </Steps.Step>

{' '}
<Steps.Step>
  Click on the `Deploy to Netlify` button above. - Authorize Netlify to connect
  with GitHub by clicking the `Connect to GitHub` button.
</Steps.Step>

{' '}
<Steps.Step>There should now be a `Save & Deploy` button, click it.</Steps.Step>

{' '}
<Steps.Step>
  Once the deployment is complete, click on the `Get Started` button that pops
  up, this will redirect you to the dashboard of your site.
</Steps.Step>

{' '}
<Steps.Step>
  Click on the only site in the `Sites` section of your dashboard.
</Steps.Step>

   <Steps.Step>
     Find the link of your site near the top of the page, it should look something like `https://<random-words>.netlify.app`. Right click the link, click `Copy link address`. [Now you'll just have to set up the client](../extra/streaming.mdx#method-1-self-hosted-proxy)!
   </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

## Method 2 - Cloudflare (Easy)

Cloudflare has a generous free plan, so you don't need to pay anything unless you get hundreds of users.

    -> Proxy.

  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

## Method 4 - Docker
If you know what you are doing, you should know what to do with this information. If you don't, then please follow our Cloudflare guides.

<Warning>
  Experience with Docker, domains and web hosting is **highly recommended** for
  this method. <br />
  [Deploying with Netlify](#method-1-netlify-easy) is easier and safer to do! You
  are exposing your server at your own risk!
</Warning>

P-Stream does not have a Docker image for the proxy yet. You can create one yourself or build from source. Alternatively, you can use the sudo-flix proxy Docker image found here: GitHub Container Registry under the image [`ghcr.io/sussy-code/sudo-proxy:latest`](https://ghcr.io/sussy-code/sudo-proxy:latest). It should work the same.


The container exposes the HTTP port (Without TLS/SSL) as `3000/TCP`.

## Method 5 - Manual
If you know what you are doing, you should know what to do with this information. If you don't, then please follow our Cloudflare guides.

Manually installing the proxy on your server. You may want to use an automated package manager like nixpacks to do this.

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    Clone the repo on your server `git clone https://github.com/p-stream/simple-proxy`
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Navigate to the directory `cd simple-proxy`
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Install packages `pnpm i`
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Build the app `pnpm build`
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Start the proxy `pnpm start`
  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

You'll need to configure port forwarding and firewall settings. Good luck.
