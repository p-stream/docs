# Support

We provide support to users and hosters in our discord server. Though we have some rules about the questions you can ask.

<Frame>
  1. Don't ask to be put on the [instances list](/instances)
  2. No asking developers to help you code
  3. No duplicate tickets

<Note>
  Only ask questions in designated support tickets, otherwise they will most
  likely not be seen or answered seriously.
